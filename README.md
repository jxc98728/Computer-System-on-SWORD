# Computer-System-on-SWORD
My project for summer courses.

The project is a computer system implementation on SWORD V4.0 platform.
It contains a MIPS multiple-cycle CPU supporting 34 different types of 
instructions, an I/O bus communicating with I/O components, a interface
for VGA monitor and PS2 keyboard.
